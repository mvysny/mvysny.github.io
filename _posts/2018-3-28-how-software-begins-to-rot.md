title: How Software Begins to Rot
---

Proper building construction is to have a proper design which includes all
latest state-of-the-art components and follow all safety precautions. The
building won't collapse and it will be great. If you however use this approach
with software, you will **fail**.

The thing is, when the building is done, it is done. Nobody will suggest
to add more elevators or change the grounding. An intelligent design, and
a total opposite to a software which is an ever-changing reshaping blob.
A living, breathing organism where anything may be subject to change. It
is never really done, and initial architecture rarely survives more than
three years.

By using lots of frameworks in the software project, albeit with best intents,
you will create bonds which artificially slow down the shape-shifting.
Too many bonds, and the software will stop moving, it will die, it will
start rotting and it will turn into a rotting steaming spaghetti of framework
workarounds and annotation magic. Your devs will waste time figuring out
how to get around the framework limitations. Good developers will get
frustrated by the slow pace and they will leave. The software will attract
framework fanatics. Under the guidance of bad developers piling workarounds
upon hacks, the team will repulse any good programmers. The software ecosystem
now reached terminal state and the software now starts to rot. Good luck
finding a team of good programmers that can now restart your project afresh.

To avoid software rot, be careful when adding frameworks, and remember to
remove them when they no longer serve any purpose and deliver no value in
your software. Only by focusing on simplicity, you will be able to evolve
the software quickly.

> Remember: Simplicity is the best future-proof that you can have in your
software.

This is the most important guiding principle in the [Vaadin on Kotlin](http://vaadinonkotlin.eu/)
framework.
