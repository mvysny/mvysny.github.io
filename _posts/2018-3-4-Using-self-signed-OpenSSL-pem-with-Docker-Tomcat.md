title: Using self-signed OpenSSL pem with Docker Tomcat
---

It is possible to use `pem`-style certificates with Tomcat Docker image, without any need to store them first into the Java keystore. This is excellent since not only it is easier to generate self-signed certificate with the `openssl` command, this can also be used with certificates produced by Let's Encrypt.

Let's first see how to use the self-signed keys with the Tomcat Docker 9 image. First we generate the self-signed certificate:

```bash
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout localhost-rsa-key.pem -out localhost-rsa-cert.pem -days 36500
```

Specify "changeit" as a password (or any other password of your chosing); the Common Name/FQDN is your domain, say, `testing.com`.

Place the generated `localhost-rsa-*.pem` files into a `ssl/` folder. Now create the following `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    image: tomcat:9.0.5-jre8
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8443:8443"
    volumes:
      - ./ssl:/usr/local/tomcat/ssl
      - ./server.xml:/usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml
```

Place the following `server.xml` file next to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

The directory structure should look like this:
```
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── server.xml
└── ssl
    ├── localhost-rsa-cert.pem
    └── localhost-rsa-key.pem
```

That's it - just run `docker-compose up` in the `.` folder and Tomcat should boot up. Now you can visit [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443) and the browser should warn you about the self-signed certificate - just store an exception for the site and you should see the Tomcat welcome page served over https.
