title: Vaadin - Troubleshooting
---

Sometimes Vaadin 14 fails mysteriously, which is very unfortunate: it now uses
LOTS of JavaScript code, frameworks and tools. Those things are unfamiliar to server-side
guys, and it's really hard to tell what to do, should one of JavaScript toolchain fail.

This article remedies that, by listing a bunch of troubleshooting ideas and FAQs to
follow and check out. We expect a basic knowledge of Vaadin toolchain here, please
read the [Vaadin: the missing guide](../2020-6-24-Vaadin-the-missing-guide/) article
and the [Vaadin Plugin under the hood](../2020-6-25-Vaadin-Plugin-under-the-hood/) article first.

TBD
