title: New Computer/New Machine Setup with Ubuntu
---

I need to setup new machine from time to time, and I always forget all the things that need to be set up.
So, here it goes.

## Software & Updates

Go to the "Updates" tab and set:
* When there are other updates: Display Immediately
* Notify me of new Ubuntu version: For any new version

Also [Updating Ubuntu Quickly](../updating-ubuntu-quickly/).

## Increase security

[Secure Boot 2](../ubuntu-secure-boot2/)
