title: Vaadin and IE11
---

[Vaadin 14 kinda supports IE11](https://vaadin.com/releases/vaadin-14#supported-browsers-and-java-versions), but there are limitations.
The performance hit is substantial, for example vaadin-grid may perform 5x-10x slower in IE11 than in Chrome or Firefox, on the same machine.
This performance hit will not be fixed (it can not be fixed) - if you need a performant
site for IE11 then Vaadin 8 is the best choice.

[Vaadin 15+ does not support IE11](https://vaadin.com/blog/vaadin-14-is-the-last-major-version-to-support-ie11)
and will display the following page:

An excellent way to test this is to take advantage of the [browserling.com](https://www.browserling.com)
page which will launch IE11 in a VM for you. For example, here's the
[https://labs.vaadin.com/business Business Starter running in IE11 on Win7](https://www.browserling.com/browse/win/7/ie/11/https%3A%2F%2Flabs.vaadin.com%2Fbusiness%2F).
