A quote from Steve Jobs first.

I observed something very early on at Apple, I didn’t know how to explain it then, but I’ve thought about it since.
Most things in life, the dynamic range between ‘average’ and the ‘best’ is, at most,
two-to-one. If you get into a cab in New York City with the best cab driver, as opposed to
the average cab driver, you’re probably going to get to your destination with the best cab driver
maybe thirty percent faster… Or a CD player, the difference between the best CD player and the
average CD player is what? Twenty percent? So two-to-one is a big dynamic range in most of life.
In software—and it used to be the case in hardware too—the difference between the average and the best is 50 to one. Maybe 100 to one.
Very few things in life are like this, but what I’ve been lucky enough to spend my life in is like this.

A small team of A+ players can run circles around a giant team of B and C players.

This is VERY important. Whenever something is 10x better or cheaper, better watch out for a huge disruption.
A small team of A+ players **completely outclass** a giant group of B and C players, and can outcompete
and completely outmanouver and always win over a group of B and C players, **of any size**.

Now how to hire the cream of the cream is out-of-scope for this article and can be found at
the [What You Can Learn From Steve Jobs About Hiring](https://artisantalent.com/steve-jobs-about-hiring/)
article. Let's instead focus on the mechanics of how exactly the A+ players almost always outclass B and C players.

## A Genealogy Of A Big Company

A company (let's call the company 'BC') hires all sorts of people: the A+ players, the A players, B and C as well.
However, usually A+ players can't stand working with Bs and Cs - they are too slow to understand,
too dumb to move quickly, too stupid to recognize an outdated technology when they see one.
The company also can't do anything groundbreaking and the company moves slow (we'll get to this later on), and so the As
grow frustrated and leave the company, leaving the company full of Bs and Cs. Don't get me
wrong: some of the As may decide to stay, to enjoy social benefits, sane working hours
and the fact that they can be done with their work in 1 hour, leaving the remainder of 7
hours to slack or do something more productive with their lives. But the As eager to change the world
will leave for sure.

In other words, the company will evolve into a company with majority of Bs and Cs. Hence the name BC.
On the other hand, a company of As will naturally clean itself of Bs and Cs (since they can't keep up).

That means that the evolution will usually drive the companies into two states: either they
have a majority of As, or a vast majority of Bs and Cs.

### A Genealogy Of the 'A' Company

The 'A' Company is full of smart people. They have grouped around a common vision,
understand the big picture and their own contribution towards the common goal.

Since they're smart they can understand the big picture and can correct their actions
so that they contribute towards the vision. They don't need to be told what to do
or that their work is counter-productive or goes the opposite way of the vision - they
will figure it out automatically and correct their actions.

They are eager to be productive and they will hate wasting time on endless meetings
and/or go through managers to get answers - the fastest way to get an answer or to get
someone collaborating is to go directly to them and tell them what you need. Since
they are also guided by the vision, they will understand and will be eager to help you.

That's why Elon Musk's (**the** guy which knows how to organize people effectively)
[7 rules](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/productivity-rules-elon-musk-says-every-effective-leader-should-embrace.html)
deter wasting time: cease having useless meetings, drop out of useless meetings,
stop using acronyms (since you waste time having to figure out what they stand for),
and stop following the communication chain of command (since it's much faster to talk
to people directly).

The 'A' company will usually have a technology-based leader. [Jobs is right in item 3](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tech/the-eight-most-important-passages-from-steve-jobs-the-lost-interview/):
a company lead by marketing or sales people will not have a good product and will repulse
A players, degrading into a BC company.

The 'A' company will have a catchy vision to change the world, since A players won't settle for anything less (and will leave).

### A Genealogy of the BC Company

Now let's take a look at a place where things fall apart. A company full of Bs and Cs.

Naturally, Bs and Cs can't keep up with As and so they will be 5-10x slower in their work,
since they have to frequently Google how to do things, copy-paste stuff from StackOverflow
incorrectly, resulting in endless cycles of bug reporting and bug fixing, which
makes the entire process 20x slower than As.

The bigger problem is that Bs and Cs don't talk to each other much. That is because
the company BC doesn't understand the value of a vision (since it can simply command people what to do, or
has been built as a hierarchy of officers pushing commands down the rank).
The employees have no shared vision, they don't have to understand the way in which their work contributes
to the bigger picture and hence they usually don't understand that. They are effectively putting
themselves into small boxes of my-work-vs-not-my-work and don't care to look outside of that box.
Since they don't peek outside of the box, they may run in random directions, randomly colliding with other
boxes or running in completely opposite directions. The company can produce nothing that
requires more than one box to cooperate.

In order to fix this situation, a hierarchy of managers is hired, to force the boxes to play
along and talk to each other. That creates another gap of performance between As and BCs
because all communication goes through
