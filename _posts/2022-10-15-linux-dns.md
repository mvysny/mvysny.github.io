title: Linux DNS stopped working
---

The newest Linux/Ubuntu 22.04+ DNS resolve stack is a fucking spaghetti of resolvconf, systemd-resolved, Network Manager
and 34724 other cryptic shit. In the good old days you would add `nameserver` to `/etc/resolv.conf` and be
done with it. Now you can't even edit the file since it's a symlink to `../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf` with `nameserver 127.0.0.53`
which is a DNS server running locally on your machine by systemd, resolving Jesus-knows-what.

If you see something like this, read on:

```bash
$ host -v www.google.com
Trying "www.google.com"
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
$ host -v www.google.com 127.0.0.53
Trying "www.google.com"
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
$ host -v www.google.com 8.8.8.8
Trying "www.google.com"
;; now works
```

To learn of the DNS routing scheme, type in the following:

```bash
$ resolvectl status
```

And it should print the DNS servers for every network interface. Make sure you can ping
all of them. Also verify that the DNS host name can be resolved against all/some of your DNS servers:

```bash
$ host www.google.com
$ host www.google.com 8.8.8.8
$ resolvectl query www.google.com
```

## How resolvectl works

Who knows :(

## wireguard + Ubuntu 22.10

If you run `wg-quick up mywg` and suddenly DNS stops working (while it worked on Ubuntu 22.04),
the reason is that resolvectl is now configured a bit differently when wireguard conf file contains a DNS entry.

* On Ubuntu 22.04, any wireguard DNS entry would go into the `Global` section of `resolvectl status`, and
  your wireguard link's `Current Scopes` would read `none`
* On Ubuntu 22.10, the wireguard DNS entry goes into your wireguard link, sets the `Current Scopes` to `DNS` and adds `DNS Domain: ~.`
  which somehow breaks your DNS.

Workaround: comment out the DNS entry in your wireguard conf file.
