title: Linux DNS stopped working
---

The newest Linux/Ubuntu 22.04+ DNS resolve stack is a fucking spaghetti of resolvconf, systemd-resolved
and 34724 other cryptic shit. In the good old days you would add `nameserver` to `/etc/resolv.conf` and be
done with it. Now you can't even edit the file since it's a symlink to `../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf` with `nameserver 127.0.0.53`
which is a DNS server running locally on your machine by systemd, resolving Jesus-knows-what.

If you see something like this, read on:

```bash
$ host -v www.google.com
Trying "www.google.com"
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
$ host -v www.google.com 127.0.0.53
Trying "www.google.com"
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
$ host -v www.google.com 8.8.8.8
Trying "www.google.com"
;; now works
```

To learn of the DNS routing scheme, type in the following:

```bash
$ resolvectl status
```

And it should print the DNS servers for every network interface. Make sure you can ping
all of them. Also verify that the DNS host name can be resolved against all/some of your DNS servers:

```bash
$ host www.google.com
$ host www.google.com 8.8.8.8
```

## How resolvectl works
