title: Eat Your Own Dogfood
---

The only way humans really learn is by their own mistakes. Make a programming mistake,
live with it, maintain it, fix it, then move on. That is the only way to grow as a developer.
That implies that if you're not also the maintainer of your own code, you can *not* grow as a developer:
there is no other way to learn from one's mistakes than by becoming a maintainer
of your own code.

## Evolution of a developer

All developers follow the ladder below:

1. Junior - wow my program starts! How cute!
2. Advanced - I can somehow create an intraweb portal! I have so much power at my fingertips!
3. Master - I have combined all design patterns into my code. I'm using all
   cool frameworks and my app needs 45 kubernetes pods to run and a dark incantations
   of 100-strong team of developers, managers, and managers of managers. I'm the king and
   the *real* developer, everybody else is just cute.
4. Guru - I have removed all frameworks and approaches except those I really need.
   I know how stupid I was before.

The only way to climb this ladder is to maintain shit you produced earlier, AKA
*dogfooding*.

The complexity increases and achieves peak at step 3, then disappears once you
start pursuing simplicity.
