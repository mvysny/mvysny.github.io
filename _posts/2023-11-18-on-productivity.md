title: On Productivity
---

What I learned when reading the [rethinking productivity in software engineering](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6)
book:

* It's a very boring book as expected; equally boring than books on project management. Instead of stories and
  lessons learned, the author decided to write a classical powerpoint-ish scientific paper perfect for PhD, but
  lacking any value for actually learning something.
* There is no silver bullet, no single performance metric.
* All performance metrics are complex, therefore useless.
* Even agile software development has no clear definition of productivity or a solution
  for measuring productivity. Velocity is so easy to misuse that one cannot recommend it.
* Your team knows when someone is slacking off. But you have to be on the factory floor to learn it.
* Code quality has direct impact on productivity.

The best way to achieve extreme productivity is to:

* [Team of A players run circles around B and C players](../on-effective-teams/).
  Hire A+ devs and let them self organise.
* Keep them motivated. Good pay is a must but it can only go as far. Flock them around a mission that actually makes sense to everyone
  and is not just an empty marketing buzzshit. Make them feel elite, that theyâ€™re changing the world.
