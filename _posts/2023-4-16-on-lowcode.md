title: On Low Code
---

The more you try to avoid coding, the more ridiculous the result will be. Prime examples: no-code, BDD.

* What low-code promises: anyone can create apps
* What low-code delivers: a new class of developers that specialize for particular low-code platform.

If that sounds like a contradiction, it's because it is. There's no way around coding. The promise
here is that managers would be able to take specs and write apps using low-code.
The hard fact is that managers can't program, and they start hiring programmers on their first
hurdle.

Now that I think about it: lots of Java frameworks tend to try to replace code with annotations...
