title: SOLID - not a fan
---

[SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)
is a way to develop your programs. I am not a huge fan, and
now [Prime put my thoughts into words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT_RLWmIsbY) very eloquently.

Maybe it's good for a newbie to try to stick to SOLID, but ultimately learn its limitations
and move beyond, and start valuing the 'locality of behavior' and simplicity principles
more than going all abstraction-crazy with SOLID. In my experience,
projects written using the latter principles are much easier to maintain than
projects built using the SOLID principle.

In other words, maybe it's good to start with SOLID, but then move beyond SOLID and
Clean Code as you grow as a developer.
