title: Apple Rant

The way Apple is sold, it's like the second coming of Jesus, yet it's riddled with bugs which would make Linux feel embarrassed.

Macbook's "Now playing" control center icon is broken by design. It tries to be too helpful
and includes both Apple Music and Safari; when I hit the "Pause" button in hopes to stop Apple Music playback,
it instead activates the Teams Safari tab and starts playing the "ringing call" sound.
What the fuck? Who at Apple thought this to be a good idea?
[Sure, instead of pausing the music, let's hear a random sound from random Safari tab instead!](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255881132?sortBy=rank).

And don't get me started on the new way of positioning windows, the "Window > Move & Resize" menu.
It's great when it works, but it doesn't work on BBEdit, and that's because BBEdit removes the "Move & Resize"
menu item from the "Window" menu. It's true that BBEdit should not do that, but BBEdit
shouldn't be allowed to do that in the first place! Also, when I press the key combo to tile windows to left,
I want The Mighty Window Manager to tile the bloody window to the left, end of story. It shouldn't be the responsibility
of the app itself capturing the shortcut, then maybe moving its window to the left (or not). What the fuck? The Window Manager needs to handle that, not the app itself!

Also, when I quit VM in Parallels or close Slack, there's like 5% probability that those apps crash & freeze, and with that, the entire fucking macOS! Da fuq?
I thought, as a profession, we moved away from DOS times where an app could overwrite entire memory and pretty much kill your PC. But no, macOS has one event
loop and if an app doesn't play nicely, everything just bloody freezes. 
The only thing that works is to right-click the app icon and select "Kill" - the option doesn't show by default and feels like the kill switch is hacked on top of MacOS Dock bar.

Also, the `~` key. It was on this particular fucking spot since the Jesus Fucking Christ
invented keyboard 2000 years ago: top-left spot just below ESC. In all but the US layouts, Apple moves it downwards next to Shift,
and there's no bloody software keyboard layout that moves tilde back up! I actually had to download
some [crazy software](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) written by some third-party dude, to create my own keyboard layout,
only to move the Tilde key to where it belongs. WTF?

I mean, many things are done in the right way, but there are some huge gaping bloody obvious usability issues,
Jobs must be rotating in his grave like a turbine.

The way iOS does app settings is a complete UX disaster too: in order to configure the app,
I have to close the app, go to Settings, find the app and set it up. WHY? I was in the fucking app already!

Also, this one is hilarious: YouTube iOS app causes iOS to draw notifications completely outside the notification area, no text clipping whatsoever. I mean Android is piece of shit and different vendors screw it up in a different way, but this kind of fuckup is like a third-grader learning to code. Screenshot incoming.

The programming environment on MacBook sucks balls. In order to install stuff, you need to
install HomeBrew: *you download a bash script from the internet and run it as root*. **NO FUCKING WAY**.

Will I abandon Apple? No. They do many things right, most importantly the privacy. Also, once the Magic Keyboard is remapped, it's extremely pleasant to type on.
The touchpad is amazing too. Now that I got things working the way I want it, the setup is pretty solid. Also, the working suspend and the entire don't-shut-off-computer-for-a-year is highly addictive too.
I'm pretty happy with my Linux-in-VM setup - Linux provides excellent programming environment,
Apple provides excellent hardware and a thin OS on top of that, and I even get to play games on a Windows-in-VM.
I love the M3 Max - finally ARM replaced the x86 garbage.
