title: Apple Rant
---

The way Apple is sold, it's like the second coming of Jesus, yet it's riddled with
bugs which would make Linux feel embarrassed.

Disclaimer: I'm still using MacOS despite its shortcomings. This is just for me to
vent, and maybe you'll agree with some of this stuff. I know Linux has many shortcomings, but
this vent made me realize that Linux did many things right,
and Apple should copy those things.

Disclaimer 2: I'm coming from Linux, and I'm NOT a Windows guy by any means.
Personally I think that [Windows is a piece of shit joke of an operating system](../windows/),
unsuitable for anything but games.

# UX

Macbook's "Now playing" control center icon is broken by design. It tries to be too helpful
and includes both Apple Music and Safari; when I hit the "Pause" button in hopes to stop Apple Music playback,
it instead activates the Teams Safari tab and starts playing the "ringing call" sound.
What the fuck? Who at Apple thought this to be a good idea?
[Sure, instead of pausing the music, let's hear a random sound from random Safari tab instead!](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255881132?sortBy=rank).

And don't get me started on the new way of positioning windows, the "Window > Move & Resize" menu.
It's great when it works, but it doesn't work on BBEdit, and that's because BBEdit removes the "Move & Resize"
menu item from the "Window" menu. It's true that BBEdit should not do that, but BBEdit
shouldn't be allowed to do that in the first place! Also, when I press the key combo to tile windows to left,
I want The Mighty Window Manager to tile the bloody window to the left, end of story. It shouldn't be the responsibility
of the app itself capturing the shortcut, then maybe moving its window to the left (or not). What the fuck? The Window Manager needs to handle that, not the app itself!

On top of that, there are two maximize functions now: `Zoom` and `Fill`. `Zoom` has no keyboard shortcut assigned and
for some apps it maximizes the app only vertically, but no horizontally (?!?!?); `Fill` is `‚åÉüåêF`
which is a PITA to press on the older "Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad" where üåê is not in lower-left spot.
And it doesn't work anyway on some apps, so I'm continuing to use the Magnet app.

When I quit VM in Parallels or close Slack, there's like 5% probability that those apps crash & freeze, and with that, the entire fucking macOS! Da fuq?
I thought, as a profession, we moved away from the MS-DOS times, where an app could overwrite entire memory and pretty much kill your PC. But noooo, macOS has one event
loop and if an app doesn't play nicely, everything just bloody freezes. 
The only thing that works is to right-click the app icon and select "Kill" - the option doesn't show by default and feels like the kill switch is hacked on top of MacOS Dock bar.

The way iOS does app settings is a complete UX disaster too: in order to configure the app,
I have to close the app, go to Settings, find the app and set it up. WHY? I was in the fucking app in the first place but okay I guess!

The programming environment on MacBook sucks balls. In order to install stuff, you need to
install HomeBrew: *you download a bash script from the internet and run it as root*. **NO FUCKING WAY**.
[Linux-in-VM saves the day](../ubuntu-in-parallels/).

MTP (transfer files to Android devices) support is [virtually non-existent](../copying-files-apple-android/) - another huge WTF.

Apple Music is confusing as hell - I don't really care for Home, New or Radio: I just want to mark a bunch of stuff favourite and listen
to those. Opening a favourite artist only shows favourite albums, leading me to believe that other albums are
not on Apple Music. I need to click on the artist name *again* (it shows as plain text, giving no impression that it's a clickable element!!), to see all albums.
Apple, please fucking fire all Apple Music UX designers and design that shit from scratch.

Opening an unresponsive page in Safari freezes not just Safari, but the entire operating system -
I thought the times of cooperative multitasking were behind us. This is just unacceptable and feels
like a project from a first-grader.

# Keyboard rant

The tilde key. With Linux, it doesn't matter what symbol is on the keyboard key;
you can activate the US layout which puts the tilde character under ESC, regardless of what the physical button on the keyboard reads.
Not with Apple. If you don't get the Mac with the US physical layout, the tilde key is moved downwards next to the left shift,
and no matter which keyboard layout I select in the settings, I can not remap the key elsewhere. I actually had to download
some [crazy software](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) written by some third-party dude, to create my own keyboard layout,
only to move the Tilde key to where I'm used to. WTF? Sure, get a Mac with the US keyboard you might say,
but in the US layout, the ENTER key occupies only one row of keys and that annoys me to no end.
AARGH I'll have to get used to the small ENTER key since the tilde position is pretty much hardwired
in my brain already.

Shortcuts in MacOS make zero sense. There are 4 modifier keys (Cmd/Option/Control/Fn!!!)
and none of those act as a global "system" modifier for invoking system-wide action
(like the "Win" key does in Windows or Linux).
Or, rather, all of them do. `‚åÉ` is generally treated as such (as a kind of system key),
but also the `üåê` (Fn) key is treated as such, e.g. `üåêE` shows the emoji keyboard. On top of that,
screen capture is a clusterfuck of wild key combinations that make zero sense.
Take `‚áß‚åò4` as an example, to capture part of the screen:

- Doesn't use `‚åÉ` nor `Fn` even though those keys are supposed to be "system-wide"
- The `4` key is completely arbitrary and makes no sense
- Always captures a rectangular screenshot: say if you want a video capture, tough luck - you need to remember another crazy keyboard combo.
- No UI option to copy the screenshot to clipboard instead of saving to desktop - you need to press `‚åÉ‚áß‚åò4` (dafuk???) for that
- Why is suddenly `‚åÉ` involved when `‚å•` would make more sense for this - since we're slightly modifying the behavior of screen capture?
- `‚áß‚åò4SpaceBar` captures current window - Why `SpaceBar`??? Also, Apple, have you realized it's not easy to press 4 keys at the same time when 2 of them are non-modifiers?

In Linux/Gnome, this is solved in a much better way:
- Press PrintScreen
- A dialog appears where you select what you want to do - e.g. capture the entire screen, or just part of the screen, or a video.
- The screenshot is stored into `~/Pictures/Screenshots` and also into clipboard.
- Okay okay, you can press `‚áß‚åò5` to get the same window - noted.

Solution which covers all of my needs:
- Map "Screenshot and recording options" to `F13` - this opens the screenshot dialog where I can select everything I need;
- Map "Copy picture of selected area to the clipboard" to `‚å•F13`
- Map "Save picture of selected area as a file" to `‚åòF13`
- (When I'm away from the numpad): `‚åòSpace` then type "Screenshot"

I know there are historic reasons since `üåê` was added later on, but still.

Now, the iPhone on-screen keyboard: it is so broken it's not even funny. The autocorrection sucks, the
UX for correcting autocorrection is horrible and I find myself fighting the UX to correct
the autocorrection suggestions; most importantly, the support for auto-switching between
three languages is non-existent. Apple, please take a hard long look at Google's keyboard,
and then copy it.

# Conclusion

I mean, many things are done in the right way, but there are some huge gaping bloody obvious usability issues,
Jobs must be rotating in his grave like a turbine.

Will I abandon Apple? No. They do many things right, most importantly the privacy.
Also, once the Magic Keyboard is remapped, it's extremely pleasant to type on.
The touchpad is amazing too. Now that I got things working the way I want it, the setup is pretty solid.
Also, the working suspend and the entire don't-shut-off-computer-for-a-year is highly addictive too.
I'm pretty happy with my Linux-in-VM setup - Linux provides excellent programming environment,
Apple provides excellent hardware and a thin OS on top of that, and I even get to play games on a Windows-in-VM.
I love the M3 Max - finally ARM replaced the x86 garbage.

Also, the Apple Cloud, Photos, Reminders, Notes, Passwords and the way it's synced across iPads, TVs and iPhones,
it's a tiny miracle - love it.
