title: k9s + microk8s
---

[k9s](https://k9scli.io) is an awesome way to manage kubernetes/microk8s over ssh
since it offers a text-based UI.

To install:
```bash
$ sudo snap install k9s
```
To [make k9s see local microk8s instance](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/issues/267#issuecomment-513431314):
```bash
$ microk8s.kubectl config view --raw > $HOME/.kube/config
```

## Logs

If k9s isn't working correctly, the [details may be in the log](https://github.com/derailed/k9s?tab=readme-ov-file#logs-and-debug-logs).
Run `k9s info` to reveal the location of the log file (in my case `/tmp/k9s-root.log`),
then run
```bash
$ tail -f /tmp/k9s-root.log
```
to reveal the log.

## kubectl

Trying to access shell fails with `Shell exec failed`. Looking into k9s logs it reveals
that `kubectl command is not in your path error="exec: \"kubectl\": executable file not found in $PATH"`.

Unfortunately, creating an alias via `alias kubectl="microk8s kubectl"` is not enough.

The easiest way is to install kubectl client:
```bash
$ sudo snap install kubectl --classic
$ kubectl get pod --all-namespaces
```

## Tips

* To quit, type `:q`
* Viewing logs will only yield `waiting for logs`: press `0` to see all logs from the top
* Try the Pulse mode via `:pulse`, it's really cool.
