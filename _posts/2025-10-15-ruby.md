title: Ruby - Getting Started
---

I tried REPL with Kotlin and Java, both sucked: REPL with Kotlin is deprecated, unsupported and getting removed;
REPL with Java is just bloated. Gave up. I'm becoming a huge fan of the "No tools" movement - use
as few tools as possible. I believe this approach leads to simplicity. Tools lead you to the vicious cycle of
complexity: tools hide the complexity away from you, which means
you're getting away with complexity, which means it creeps in, and you solve that with more tools.
No-tools also simplifies the ramp-up for newbies: imagine a newbie having to study Maven/Gradle, Intellij
just to run Hello World app and then do something just a tiny bit more complex (like parsing YAML/JSON/XML or such).

Anyways, REPL in Ruby is so simple. To remove blank lines and comments from a file, you just need to run:
```bash
$ ruby -ne 'puts $_ unless $_.strip.empty? or $_.lstrip.start_with? "#"' <file
```
Autocompletion? Works! Run `irb`, type in `"foo".` and press TAB to cycle through stuff.

You can `sudo apt install ruby` but it's not newest; the best way is to install via `sudo snap install ruby --classic`.
The snap comes straight from Ruby core team and is thus safe to install.

# Fast

Ruby VM is so fast to start, it's not even funny. Sure, Java programs start fast too, unless you're running them
from Gradle - and then Gradle either takes 2 seconds to run, or takes shitload of RAM for Gradle Daemon.
This has also huge advantage with GitHub Actions: Ruby springs to life and Rake builds your project so fast,
the entire thing is done in 10 seconds. Compared to that, Gradle builds always take at least 1 minute.

# No Tooling Required

`irb` auto-completion is brilliant, and it comes straight with Ruby - no need to install tools or anything else.
You only need a text editor and `irb` to get started. Excellent. `rake` is also baked in, so you can quickly start
writing build scripts.

REPL is supported out-of-the-box. Not just that - Ruby is perfect for small scripts, possibly replacing bash.

## gems

At some point you'll need gems, for example when generating documentation via YARD. This exposes the fact that many Ruby
gems are half-implemented in C and require some tooling to update. I don't mind: I won't be studying their sources,
and I'm not forced to write C, so I'm good.

To update all gems, you'll need to run:
```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential libffi-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev
```
To update gems:
```bash
$ gem update
```
Gem updates will be installed into your HOME folder `~/.gem`.

shows how to run all that from GitHub Actions.
