[Swift](https://www.swift.org/) looks really good - strong-typed,
the API makes sense, first-class support for native, and now you can develop in Linux
as well. The disadvantage is that the produced binaries depend on Swift being installed,
which means that you need to install Swift wherever you plan to run your binary.
This blog shows how to install and develop Swift on Ubuntu 25.04 aarch64.

## Installing stuff

To start with Ubuntu 25.04, simply install Swift via apt:
```bash
$ sudo apt install swiftlang binutils-gold
```

Then install IDEA, the community edition is enough:
```bash
$ sudo snap install intellij-idea-community
```
Afterwards, install the [Swift Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22150-swift-support)
plugin by Joachim Ansong.

The plugin doesn't support navigating to certain classes (e.g. you can't
navigate to Foundation classes like String), but you can navigate to classes from your dependencies
and the autocompletion works quite well.

## Getting Started

You can follow the [Building a Command-line Tool](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/cli-swiftpm/)
tutorial to build and run a basic CLI app.

## Working with files

Reading a file is easy: `main.swift`:
```swift
import Foundation
print(try String(contentsOfFile: "foo.txt"))
print(try FileManager.default.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: "/home"))
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get this error while running `swift build`:
```
error: link command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
clang-15: error: invalid linker name in argument '-fuse-ld=gold'
```
Make sure `binutils-gold` is installed on your machine.
