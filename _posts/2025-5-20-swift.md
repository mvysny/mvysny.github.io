[Swift](https://www.swift.org/) looks really good - strong-typed,
the API makes sense, first-class support for native, and now you can develop in Linux
as well. The disadvantage is that the produced binaries depend on Swift being installed,
which means that you need to install Swift wherever you plan to run your binary.
This blog shows how to install and develop Swift on Ubuntu 25.04 aarch64.

# Installing stuff

To start with Ubuntu 25.04, simply install Swift via apt:
```bash
$ sudo apt install swiftlang binutils-gold
```

Then install IDEA, the community edition is enough:
```bash
$ sudo snap install intellij-idea-community
```
Afterwards, install the [Swift Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22150-swift-support)
plugin by Joachim Ansong.

The plugin doesn't support navigating to certain classes (e.g. you can't
navigate to Foundation classes like String), but you can navigate to classes from your dependencies
and the autocompletion works quite well.

Alternatively you can [use VSCode](https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-vscode-swift.html)
but the VSCode Swift plugin seems to be a bit worse than IDEA Swift. The best
is XCode on Mac.

# Getting Started

You can follow the [Building a Command-line Tool](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/cli-swiftpm/)
tutorial to build and run a basic CLI app.

## Running

Open the terminal in Intellij and run `swift run`. You can also create a run configuration
in IDEA; a "Shell Script" works best:

* Execute: `Script text`
* Script text: `swift run`

Press `Ctrl+F10` to run the app.

## Troubleshooting

If you get this error while running `swift build` or `swift run`:
```
error: link command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
clang-15: error: invalid linker name in argument '-fuse-ld=gold'
```
Make sure `binutils-gold` is installed on your machine.

## Working with files

Reading a file is easy: `main.swift`:
```swift
import Foundation
print(try String(contentsOfFile: "foo.txt"))
print(try FileManager.default.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: "/home"))
```

# About the language

Swift have several features which make it remarkably close to Kotlin:
multi-line strings, strings with interpolation, types (`Int`, `UInt`, etc),
optional types (`Int?`).
The lack of GC is a bit of a bummer, but the reference counting hopefully makes
up for it, and reference counting makes more sense in embedded environments such as
phones, arm SOCs and Apple Watches.

I don't get the exception mechanism: all the `try`/`try?` stuff, and that you need
to add `throws` to all functions... Yes, stack unwinding is expensive but exceptions
are thrown sparingly in Kotlin program, so it's an acceptable penalty. Also,
why `fatalError()` when you can just bubble the exception out of `main()`?
If I only use `fatalError()` (no `try/try?/throws`) and `try!` (when calling something
that `throws`), this prints the best stack trace on failure but won't call `defer{}` blocks.
On the other hand, using `try`+`throws` everywhere feels excessive and dumb.
Java exception mechanism and Kotlin's `use{}` is far superior.

`guard` looks weird: I like Kotlin's way of simply using the `?:` operator more:
```kotlin
val foo = "25".toIntOrNull() ?: return
```
more than Swift's
```swift
guard let name = Int("25") else { return }
```

Also, when I'm implementing `Sequence`, why can't my struct simply implement `Sequence<Foo>`
but instead I have to type in `typealias Element = Foo` within the struct body?

Do I like Swift much more than Go, C, C++, Dart, Objective-C? You bet. More than Kotlin/Native?
Probably yes - Kotlin/Native file support is barebones, and Kotlin/Native
binaries can't be build on arm64. More than Kotlin/JVM? Nope - JVM is rock-solid and
offers so much; but it's unfit for really limited embedded (anything that has less than 128mb of memory).
