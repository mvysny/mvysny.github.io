title: Linux and Hardware
---

Now that I dissed on [Apple](../apple-rant/) and [Windows](../windows/), you probably want
to tell me to get a Linux machine and shut up about it, and you are probably right. And that's the problem - I can't.

Don't get me wrong. Linux support for hardware is top-notch these days. I'm sure you can
buy any laptop and Linux would boot on it and most of the things would work, if not all.
The problem is elsewhere.

With Apple, I know that if I pay the Apple Tax, I'm getting a top-notch machine.
The machine:

- [won't get sticky by just sitting in the closet](https://youtu.be/4wrJE3SBTBU?si=Jdif0FV9gsEYDU5V&t=110),
- will charge off any USB-C port
- won't slow down to a crawl when I try to screenshare a VM via Google Hangouts (looking at you, Lenovo ThinkPad T14s)
- won't suddenly print error messages that USB hub failed to allocate resources then start disconnecting USB devices randomly
  (again Lenovo ThinkPad T14s, same thing on Linux and on Windows, leading me to believe that it's Lenovo saving on USB subsystem)

My last machine was Lenovo ThinkPad T14s, which was a pretty expensive machine (2000 eur) yet [it constantly failed to deliver](../networking-lenovo-t14s-sucks/).
And there's no way to tell these things up-front - you have to get the machine, try it out, find these kinds of issues as soon as possible,
then return it quickly and try out something else. And you know what? I'm fucking tired of that.

So, Linux is not the problem here: the problem is that the x86 machines are all shit - either they lack performance, or they are loud,
or there's something else wrong with them internally. I love the fact I can get a 2 TB SSD for 150 eur and expand the memory
as well, but if the laptop isn't going to perform, then why bother? At the end, I'll get a MacBook Pro,
which is fucking expensive (4000 eur for a machine with 48 GB of RAM and 2 TB of SSD is a joke), but I'll save time
and my energy and I'll just run Linux in UTM on top of that.
