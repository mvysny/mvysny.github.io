title: Terrible experience with FedEx
---

The delivery guy dropped first package to a different
place; second package stuck in local depot with no estimate;
chat useless.

# First Package

I was really looking forward to testing out the Framework
computer. It was scheduled to be delivered via FedEx, so
I installed the FedEx app. It looked medieval but hey at least
it shown my package, its routing history and the estimated delivery date.
So far so good.

Upon the delivery date I worked from home so that I would be ready
to receive the package. Nothing happened at all, and at the evening
I received a message that the delivery failed and the message is
returned to the local depot. The courier attached the photo
of a house which isn't mine - the bloody courier
just tried to drop my expensive laptop to a random house 200 meters
away and backed off since I wasn't home. Well I was home, it's just
I happened to be at home in my own bloody house
200 meters away!

Lesson #1: don't trust couriers to find your house, use postal lockers.

FedEx told me they will try to make one more delivery before returning
the parcel to the sender. Brilliant - the courier will once again try to drop my
expensive laptop to a random neigbour; then the postal machinery will
send the laptop back to Germany. So I reached out to FedEx support.

## FedEx Support is terrible

FedEx web site allows you to send feedback, apparently to `/dev/null`
since nobody bothered to reply to this day. Fortunately there's
a chat window. The lady was super-nice but super-unhelpful:
she couldn't tell me where the package was, and she couldn't arrange
delivery to a postal locker - only to a FedEx office at Vantaa Airport.
That was a bit far, and I doubt that would happen: you see, FedEx
already gave the parcel to some local Finnish company and apparently
has no levers to redirect the package anymore.

So, a complete frustrating clusterfuck. Long story short, the local company sent me a SMS and
I was able to arrange pickup from a locker.

## The UX is horrible

FedEx app shows the package as undelivered days after I got the laptop.
So, the app is medieval, slow, shows obsolete data, and offers no
possibility to contact anyone nor to change the delivery method.

Compared to that, Finnish Postti is just awesome: the app looks modern;
the app will notify me if I have a possibility to change delivery method;
and the couriers are able to find my house.

# Second package

Framework display stopped working on day 1 after the eDP cable was cut
by laptop's hinges and then short-circuited with a bright light and
a bunch of smoke. Luckily Framework support is top-notch, replied in a day
and quickly arranged for a shipment of the replacement cable + display.
Via FedEx. Great.

This time a FedEx contractor reached out via SMS and offered a wednesday
delivery. Since I wasn't at home, I changed the delivery for Thursday.
(Sure, since it's FedEx, I probably have to be present in every house in a 200 meter radius, but still, there's hope this time they'll send someone that can use Google Maps).

Long story short: Thursday no delivery, app shows package in local depot, no estimate date.
Friday no delivery, app shows package in local depot, no estimate date.
Saturday I'm calling provided phone number, where I am welcomed by a friendly
AI and I'm told that my package is in a local depot, no estimate date.
AI told me that a human will be present on a workday (Monday in two days),
I'll let you know afterwards how the story ends.
